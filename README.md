### Abstract
```
With the rapid expansion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, energy consumption and delay-sensitive task offloading remain major concerns, particularly in fog computing environments. This research addresses the critical and growing challenges of energy consumption and task offloading within the expanding realm of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Despite advancements in fog and cloud computing, a significant gap exists in traditional offloading strategies that fail to meet better performance due to long-distance data transmission. There is also a need for more intelligent mechanisms for task prioritization, efficient transmission scheduling, and dynamic adaptation to fluctuating network conditions. To address these limitations, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the ML-based approach, a predictive task offloading system designed for an IoT environment. ML-based task offloading integrates a supervised machine learning algorithm to offload tasks based on device capabilities dynamically. Thus offering a viable solution to task offloading with minimal energy and maximum throughput.
Through extensive experiments on IoT data sets, the study assessed ML-based offloading and found that it outperformed baseline strategies. The results demonstrated that the ML-based approach achieved a high accuracy of 92% and a performance of 10-15% over baseline approaches.
The implications of these findings are substantial for the design and deployment of future IIoT systems. This research contributes valuable insights into creating "green" IIoT systems that improve Quality of Service (QoS) by meeting stringent energy constraints by illustrating the effective integration of machine learning models for intelligent resource management and task offloading in fog-cloud environments. This work provides a foundation for developing more sustainable and efficient industrial automation and innovative environmental solutions.

### Introduction

- _Internet of Things (IoT)_ has rapidly transformed various industries, including smart cities, healthcare, and more.

- _The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)_ extends these benefits to industrial applications, revolutionizing manufacturing, supply chain management, and industrial processes through automation.

- A compelling business use case in the IIoT space comes from a smart city project in the Netherlands, where streetlights are intelligently controlled based on real-time needs â€” such as traffic movement or pedestrian presence.

- The demand for IIoT solutions includes:
  - Reduced downtime  
  - Increased productivity  
  - Optimized resource utilization

- **Value at Stake**: A recent Cisco study estimated that applying IIoT in five business areas has the potential to deliver $14.4 trillion in value for private-sector companies, driven by cost savings and increased revenue through IIoT strategies.

- Key factors influencing IIoT performance include:
  - Latency  
  - Energy consumption  
  - Scalability

- Challenges in traditional cloud-based architectures:
  - Decision delays due to the large volume of data generated by IIoT devices

- **Offloading** plays a vital role by transferring data processing to resource-rich remote devices.
