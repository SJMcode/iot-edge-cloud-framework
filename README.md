# IoT Edge-Cloud Collaborative Framework
Master's Thesis project focuses on developing an intelligent framework that optimizes resource collaboration between edge and cloud computing for Smart IoT applications.

## Abstract
```
With the rapid expansion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, energy 
consumption and delay-sensitive task offloading remain critical challenges, particularly in fog computing 
environments. This research addresses the critical and growing challenges of energy consumption and 
task offloading within the expanding realm of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Despite the 
advancement in fog and cloud computing, a significant gap exists in current approaches. Traditional 
cloud-based solutions fail to meet stringent delay constraints due to long-distance data transmission. 
There is also need for more intelligent mechanisms for task prioritization, efficient transmission 
scheduling, and dynamic adaptation to fluctuating network conditions. To address these limitations, the 
primary objective of this research adopted a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to develop an 
energy optimization framework, integrating a heuristic-based transmission scheduling strategy and a 
ML-based task-offloading. An intensive computer simulation demonstrates that the proposed framework 
achieves a 10â€“15% improvement in energy efficiency for IIoT task offloading compared to baseline 
models. The key findings of this paper obtained through intensive computer simulations demonstrate the 
effectiveness of ML-based intelligent framework. 
The implications of these findings are substantial for the design and deployment of future IIoT systems. 
This research contributes valuable insights into creating "green" IIoT systems that improves Quality of 
Service (QoS) by meeting stringent energy constraints by illustrating the effective integration of machine 
learning models for intelligent resource management and task offloading in fog-cloud environments, this 
work provides a foundation for developing more sustainable and efficient industrial automation and smart 
environment solutions.
